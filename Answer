Thanks! Based on your answers, here’s a tailored curriculum to make you job-ready as an AI/Data Science engineer in 2 months, aligned with your strengths and style (project-based, pragmatic, intelligent, fast-tracked):
🧠 Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1–2)
🎯 Goal: Establish confidence in CS fundamentals and data fluency

    Projects

        Build a terminal-based to-do app in Python using sqlite3

        Scrape some data (e.g. books, headlines) and clean/analyze it using pandas

    Topics & Tools

        Python essentials (functions, OOP, data structures)

        Git + GitHub basics (push/pull/branch)

        Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas

        CS50 (first 4 lectures only, optional) or Python + Algo refresher

🤖 Phase 2: AI/Data Track (Week 3–5)
🎯 Goal: Get hands-on with AI/ML models and workflows

    Projects

        Sentiment analyzer on scraped text

        Small chatbot with transformers

        Jupyter notebook: "Human Productivity Metrics" from open datasets

    Topics & Tools

        Scikit-learn: regression, classification, pipelines

        HuggingFace transformers: fine-tune a small model

        Google Colab, Kaggle notebooks

        APIs and using AI models programmatically

🧪 Phase 3: Production/Portfolio (Week 6–7)
🎯 Goal: Make your work shine + simulate job skills

    Projects

        Build an AI-powered productivity app (GPT + UI or CLI)

        Deploy one app on Streamlit or FastAPI + HuggingFace spaces

        Create a GitHub repo per project with a clean README

    Tools & Skills

        Docker (just basics for reproducibility)

        Unit testing with pytest

        REST APIs (FastAPI)

        Streamlit or Gradio for fast demos

🧑‍💻 Phase 4: Job-Prep (Week 8)
🎯 Goal: Apply, pitch, and interview with confidence

    Practice LeetCode 1 hour/day

    Review ML concepts (bias/variance, metrics, pipelines)

    Prepare a 2-minute story for each project

    Build a simple website to showcase your projects + resume (GitHub Pages or Notion)

✨ Bonus Suggestions

    Use Emacs as your power center (Jupyter plugin, shell, Git integration)

    Start a logbook file to track your learning and reflections

    Write short posts on what you’re building (LinkedIn or a blog) — this builds credibility fast

Would you like me to turn this into a Notion board or checklist file for easier daily tracking?
