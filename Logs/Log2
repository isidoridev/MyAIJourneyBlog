Did some Hackerranks. Improved my string abilities. I also did a NumPy challenge. 

I think my objectives were imprecise from my last log. I didn't achieve any big ones, really. I got obsessed with getting 4 stars on my Python Hackerrank after doing some to warm-up my programming skills. 

So tomorrow I'm gonna do a *linked list* to work on my DS&A skills. Anything extra (basic huggingface tutorial) is a bonus.

And yes, I really have to re-learn such basic algorithms. So much time has passed since I've practiced them, and I was never super-confident with python.

Maybe I should setup 3 activities: Python, DS&A, LLMs. (Since those are the things that I want to become proficient at).

I can skip on improving my Python skills to a point, but DS&A and LLMs are very insecure and I should bounce between them before changing up.

DS&A: linked lists, binary search, quick sort, BFS, DFS.
LLMs: Basic Hugging Face tutorial.

Remember to try and do some dictionary problems later this week.

Good luck :)
